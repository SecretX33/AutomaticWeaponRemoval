## FAQ

**Q:** Does the addon really works, I mean, will it really unequip my weapons if Lady casts Dominate Mind on me?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** Is that some kind of dark magic?

**A:** No.

**Q:** Can I get banned by using this addon?

**A:** Read [this](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/can-i-get-banned-for-this/78719/8) if you are afraid, but tl;dr answer is *no*, addons can do only what Blizzard allows in their API, all I did was use the API in a creative way.

**Q:** I have a great idea for you to change X thing on your addon, how can I contact you?

**A:** That's nice to hear! Please, open an issue with the tag *suggestion* or *idea* and tell me what's on your mind.

**Q:** Your addon is awesome, but I really miss an UI (User Interface), couldn't you add one?

**A:** Yes and no. I am by no means a "professional add-on developer" of some sort, I made this addon for fun, and to help my guild. I don't know how to make an add-on interface, but I can research it, if you guys really want one let me know and I'll make one.
